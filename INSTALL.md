## Explaination for each step:

To run the application:

1.  **cd into the project directory**
    This command changes your current directory in the terminal to the root of the project, where all the project files are located. This is necessary so that subsequent commands can find the `package.json` file and other project-related resources.

2.  **run "npm i"**
    This command, short for "npm install", reads the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` listed in the `package.json` file. It then downloads and installs all the necessary packages and libraries that the project needs to run. These packages are typically stored in a `node_modules` directory within your project.

3.  **run "npm run dev"**
    This command executes a script named "dev" defined in the `package.json` file. In most React/Vite projects, this script starts a development server. This server compiles your React components, bundles your assets, and serves the application locally, often with features like hot module reloading (HMR) for a better development experience.

4.  **open the localhost link in your browser to view the project.**
    After the development server starts, it will typically output a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) in your terminal. Copy this URL and paste it into your web browser's address bar. This will load the application in your browser, allowing you to interact with it.
